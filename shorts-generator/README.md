# Shorts Generator

This project is intended to create Youtube Shorts style videos given a text prompt for a text to speech voice to say. Music is then composited over the speech, and finally the speech with music is given video to play over. Because the files used by the script to draw music and video from are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, users will have to use their own.
