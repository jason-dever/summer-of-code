# The oldest projects I have, from when I was just starting out with programming as a 16 year old. (CODE QUALITY MAY BE DUBIOUS)

I had written my first line of code before I turned 13, but those programs are lost to time, so the oldest projects I have are the ones from when I was rediscovering programming as a 16 year old in the spring of 2023.
